# TextPrediction
Recent Google and Facebook focused on behind-the-scenes mechanisms of text prediction. In addition to using Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Networks for the motivation, there were two word2vec models for generating word embeddings also discussed.

and converted to ONNX format (https://github.com/onnx/onnx) running in ONNXRuntime (https://github.com/Microsoft/onnxruntime).
